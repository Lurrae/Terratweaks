A highly-configurable collection of vanilla changes brought to you by the developers of Terrarmory! Most of these changes are quite minor, but there are some additional features which significantly alter the balance of vanilla Terraria. These are disabled by default. Terratweaks also has numerous mod calls, which are listed at the bottom of the Steam Workshop page for those interested (mainly mod developers).
This mod currently implements too many changes to list in the mod browser description, so if you'd like a full list, check out the Steam Workshop page! You can also browse the mod config to see the options as well.
